## Introduction

MQTT is a light weight messaging protocol for use on top of the TCP/IP protocol. It is designed for connections with remote locations where a “small code footprint” is required or the network bandwidth is limited.It is a communication protocol which almost can link all networked objects with the external, and it is used as a sensor. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT

## Local Test Environment

Brokers acting as Mqtt Servers mainly use the Mosquitto program. Download and install the Mosquitto tool from the following link. https://mosquitto.org
Connect your Mosquitto-installed PC and WizFi360 to the same Router (AP).

Open a command prompt window and navigate to the path where Mosquitto is installed. (cd C: \ Program Files \ mosquitto)
Then run the following command: (mosquitto -c mosquitto.conf -p 1883 -v) 1883 is the port number, and Mqtt usually uses the 1883 port number.
